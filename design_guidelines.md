# Kurdish Dubbing Application - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Design System with Creative Media Inspiration

**Justification:** This is a utility-focused transcription/translation tool requiring clarity and efficiency, but with creative media elements. We'll use Material Design principles as the foundation, drawing inspiration from modern media tools like Descript and Riverside.fm for the upload/playback interfaces.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Clarity and efficiency in workflow presentation
- Professional yet approachable aesthetic
- Clear visual feedback for multi-step processes
- Kurdish cultural respect through thoughtful color choices
